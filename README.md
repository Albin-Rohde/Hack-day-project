### This was made during salts "hackday"
1 day to build something completly from scratch.


### This app lets you create your own portfolio based on your instagram.
You will then be able to download your own copy of the website you designed
in html, css. To host wherever you want.

The purpose of this is to give non coders the possibilities to create their own 
portfolio based on their instagram feed. For example hobby photographers.


### This website is currently hosted on https://create-portfolio.herokuapp.com/
You will not be able to run this from localhost. Allthough the code from this repo.
Alltough the code running on heroku is the same code as this.

## The app is in sandbox mode.
This means that there are only a few instagram accounts that are allowed to use the app
at the moment. Use:

#### Username: john_doe_photographer
#### Password: albin123

When prompt for instagram login.
